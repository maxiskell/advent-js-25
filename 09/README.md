🔴 HARD

The elves have built a robot vacuum reindeer 🦌 (`@`) to tidy up the workshop a bit for Christmas.

The reindeer moves on a board to pick things up from the floor (`*`) and must avoid obstacles (`#`).

You will receive two parameters:
- `board`: a `string` that represents the board.
- `moves`: a `string` with the moves: `'L'` (left), `'R'` (right), `'U'` (up), `'D' `(down).

Movement rules:
- If the reindeer goes off the board or crashes into an obstacle (`#`) → return `'crash'`.
- If the reindeer picks something up from the floor (`*`) during the moves → return `'succes'`.
- If the reindeer doesn't pick anything up and doesn't crash → return `'fail'`.

Important: Keep in mind that in the `board` the first and last lines are blank and must be discarded.

Example:
```js
const board = `
.....
.*#.*
.@...
.....
`

moveReno(board, 'D')
// ➞ 'fail' -> it moves but doesn’t pick anything up

moveReno(board, 'U')
// ➞ 'success' -> it picks something up (*) just above

moveReno(board, 'RU')
// ➞ 'crash' -> it crashes into an obstacle (#)

moveReno(board, 'RRRUU')
// ➞ 'success' -> it picks something up (*)

moveReno(board, 'DD')
// ➞ 'crash' -> it crashes into the bottom of the board

moveReno(board, 'UUU')
// ➞ 'success' -> it picks something up from the floor (*) and then crashes at the top

moveReno(board, 'RR')
// ➞ 'fail' -> it moves but doesn’t pick anything up
```
